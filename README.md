Medieval Hack and slash pixel art 2D game - The main objective of this project is to implement an artificial intelligence that creates fun moments while playing against it with complex decisions based on behavior trees as well as implementing fast and smooth movement mechanics with satisfying feeling for the player.

An additional challenge I set for myself, which is trying to immerse the player in the experience, or what is known as create great game feel. In this project, I focused on improving this aspect.
